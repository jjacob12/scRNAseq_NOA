Overview

This repository contains the analysis of seven single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in vitro samples of sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) cells and non-malignant human iPSC-derived cerebellar organoids. These samples represent a comparative study involving two distinct SHH-MB cell lines: DAOY and ONS-76. For each cell line, the cells were grown under various conditions:

- Monolayer
- Tumour spheroid
- Co-culture of tumour spheroid with non-malignant cerebellar organoid
- Control non-malignant cerebellar organoid
- 
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover the cellular and molecular dynamics of SHH-MB under different growth conditions, in particular the effect of the tumour micro-environment, which we simulated using cerebellar organoids. This study contributes to our understanding of medulloblastoma pathobiology and potential therapeutic targets.

Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the datasets, please ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed. The primary analysis is conducted in R Markdown documents, which can be rendered to produce comprehensive reports.

Clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the scRNAseq_NOA folder. Open the R Markdown files in RStudio to execute or modify the analysis.

Data Availability

scRNA-seq data have been deposited in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and are publicly accessible through GEO accession number GSE254917 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE254917)
